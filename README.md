# Satchel-Scanner
Back in the end of 2011 Blizzard implemented a feature known as "Call to Arms". This was introduced to reduce waiting times inside the Dungeon Finder by handing out a reward to certain specializations.

The reward for when there was an shortage of i.e Tanks or Healers, would be a "Satchel". Given to the specialization if they signed up and completed the dungeon. These Satchels contains appropriate loot for the current expansion. Gold, items, etc.

This addon scans the Dungeon Finder/Raid Finder for when Call to Arms is active.

If there is a reward available, you will be notified.

If there is a satchel for (Tank/Healer/Dps) from Instance X it will notify you with warning that you can get a Satchel from Instance X for Specialization Y.

    How do I use the addon?

        '/ss3 toggle'                     This will show the Mainframe of the addon.
        '/ss3 config'                     This will open the configuration page.
        '/ss3 reset'                       This will reset the addon to it's default settings
        '/ss3 reset-counter'        This will reset the satchel counter
        '/ss3 start'                        This will start the scanner
        '/ss3 stop'                        This will stop the scanner
        '/ss3 faq'                          This will open the FAQ/About page

    Once the addon is open:

    Press 'Start' to start scanning and 'Stop' to stop scanning (these buttons make the addon save the options/instance).
    Pressing X will hide the frame and you will have to show it again by using /ss3 toggle.
    The addon still scans while being hidden, if a satchel is found the Main window will show itself.
